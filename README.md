# Python API Challenge
The Python API Challenge project involves analysing weather data to investigate the correlation between a city's distance from the equator and its weather conditions. The analysis of weather data from over 500 cities was conducted in the WeatherPy project. The citipy and OpenWeatherMap API were utilised for this purpose. The analysis employs scatter plots and linear regressions to illustrate the correlation between latitude and different weather variables, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The second section, VacationPy, utilises weather data to strategize optimal vacation plans. A map is generated utilising the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to showcase cities that have optimal weather conditions. Hotels located within a radius of 10,000 metres from the chosen cities have been identified. A .gitignore file is utilised to exclude the api_keys.py file, which contains API keys, from being publicly shared, in order to ensure data security. The project utilises Python scripting and APIs to retrieve data and generate visualisations that offer insights into the correlation between weather patterns and geographical location.
